# EMG-Data-Analyzer-for-Muscle-Fatigue-Analysis

This program was the culmination of two years of research at Baylor University's BioMotion Lab. A 16-channel EMG sensor system was attached to the muscles of subjects as 
they ran on a treadmill and recorded muscle signals. EMG data was recorded on a seperate device and saved in CSV format.

The program takes in CSV files of EMG data (can select as many as needed, up to 16 channels). Once you select the active EMGs, define the desired pulse definition (the 
parameters of what the program considers to be a muscular activation from the EMG data).

Once you select generate output, an output csv file is created with processed data and graphs detailing the detected muscle activity.
